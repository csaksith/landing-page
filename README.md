# Odin Landing Page

This project is part of The Odin Project's Foundations curriculum. The goal of this project is to build a landing page for a fictional company using only HTML and CSS.

## Purpose

The project aims to demonstrate the following skills:
- Structuring a webpage with semantic HTML tags.
- Styling elements using CSS for layout and design.
- Implementing a flexbox layout to create a responsive and visually appealing design.
- Linking CSS files to HTML for external styling.

## Features

- A hero section with a main heading and call-to-action buttons.
- Multiple sections with content such as images, text, and links.
- A footer with relevant links and information.
- Responsive design principles to ensure usability across different screen sizes.

## Reflection

By completing this project, I will have reinforced my understanding of semantic HTML and basic CSS styling. Working with flexbox will further solidify my ability to create responsive layouts. This project will serve as a stepping stone for building more complex websites in the future.
